Bicycle theft in Ireland is a serious issue, with bicycle thefts increasing 7.5 percent year on year. These crimes are concentrated around city centres. Between Janurary 2016, and June 2018 over 14,000 bicycles were stolen in Ireland.The aim of this project is to create a bike lock that senses if the bike is in danger of being stolen. If it is then an alarm will be set off, alerting people nearby.
